    <h3>Andrew Parker</h3>
    Andrew is the chairman and founder of In Your Defence Limited. His groundbreaking concept was our unique Fixed Fee approach to all our work on behalf of suspects and defendants. Unlike most firms, he did not want us to represent on a client account or Legal Aid basis. Many doubted that this transforming policy would work, but the volume of successful cases over recent years is proof that his nationwide vision for In Your Defence Ltd was correct.
    
    Andrew's great expertise is in&nbsp;ensuring our clients gain from our unique, proactive services at the investigation stage. He also actively oversees&nbsp;the cases until they are successfully concluded. He has decades of&nbsp;experience in dealing with all sorts of charges; from minor to major. He&nbsp;established Hedley-Saunders &amp; Co and then the very successful M23Law motoring law brand.&nbsp;For the last decade at Hedley-Saunders &amp;&nbsp;Co he was&nbsp;Head of Criminal Law and has a tremendous record on serious cases, such as the 29 murder or attempted murder matters.
    
    In Your Defence Ltd Solicitors are specialists in criminal law. We are experts in defending suspects and defendants of all ages and backgrounds. We defend the whole range of offences, from relatively minor cases to serious matters such as murder. &nbsp;
    
    Andrew&nbsp;also heads up our specialist operation&nbsp;teams,&nbsp;advising and representing&nbsp;clients throughout England &amp; Wales. Clients and potential clients journey from all points of the compass to consult and&nbsp;benefit from his extensive, insightful, approach.
    
    As company chairman, Andrew has wider responsibilities including being our CEO. He is actively involved in business project management as well as the day to day cases. He is approved by the Solicitors Regulation Authority as our compliance COFA officer.
