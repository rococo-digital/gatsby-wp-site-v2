    <h3>Notable cases</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        A middle-aged male client, of previous good character, was arrested in a pub where he had travelled to meet the father of a young teenage girl. This was with a view to then going back to their family home and having sexual contact with the girl. He was met by police officers who arrested him for a number of sexual offences. He was represented at the Police Station by a Legal Aid Lawyer but came to us for our Second Opinion Service. As a result, we represented him at both the magistrates and crown court, resulting him narrowly avoiding an immediate custodial sentence.
      </li>
      <li>
        A married male client had been communicated with and grooming a teenage boy leading to several episodes of sexual contact. The client consulted us at the Investigation Stage and spent many months under investigation, pending a decision by the police and CPS. Unfortunately, his marriage and freedom were affected as he received an immediate custodial sentence at the crown court. We managed to keep his sentence to the minimum possible in the circumstances.
      </li>
      <li>
        Another significant case for In Your Defence Limited was where our client communicated with a schoolgirl over a period of time and eventually met her in a car park. They travelled to another location where sexual contact occurred. The client was on police bail for many months but was later charged and taken to court. The damning evidence included photographs taken in the car and our client pleaded guilty, however he received a suspended sentence of imprisonment.
